ECLIPSE ANDROID PROJECT IMPORT SUMMARY
======================================

Ignored Files:
--------------
The following files were *not* copied into the new Gradle project; you
should evaluate whether these are still needed in your project and if
so manually move them:

* Android.mk
* Android.mk~
* library/
* library/ShellCommand/
* library/ShellCommand/.Android.mk.swp
* library/ShellCommand/Android.mk
* library/ShellCommand/AndroidManifest.xml
* library/ShellCommand/src/
* library/ShellCommand/src/com/
* library/ShellCommand/src/com/jaredrummler/
* library/ShellCommand/src/com/jaredrummler/android/
* library/ShellCommand/src/com/jaredrummler/android/shell/
* library/ShellCommand/src/com/jaredrummler/android/shell/CommandResult.java
* library/ShellCommand/src/com/jaredrummler/android/shell/Shell.java
* library/ShellCommand/src/com/jaredrummler/android/shell/ShellExitCode.java
* library/ShellCommand/src/com/jaredrummler/android/shell/ShellNotFoundException.java
* library/ShellCommand/src/com/jaredrummler/android/shell/StreamGobbler.java
* sync.sh

Moved Files:
------------
Android Gradle projects use a different directory structure than ADT
Eclipse projects. Here's how the projects were restructured:

* AndroidManifest.xml => helloworld/src/main/AndroidManifest.xml
* libs/constraint-layout-solver-1.0.2.jar => helloworld/libs/constraint-layout-solver-1.0.2.jar
* res/ => helloworld/src/main/res/
* src/ => helloworld/src/main/java/
* src/com/edit/helloworld/.MainActivity.java.swp => helloworld/src/main/resources/com/edit/helloworld/.MainActivity.java.swp

Next Steps:
-----------
You can now build the project. The Gradle project needs network
connectivity to download dependencies.

Bugs:
-----
If for some reason your project does not build, and you determine that
it is due to a bug or limitation of the Eclipse to Gradle importer,
please file a bug at http://b.android.com with category
Component-Tools.

(This import summary is for your information only, and can be deleted
after import once you are satisfied with the results.)
